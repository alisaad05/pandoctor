    <UL>
      <LI>This function call is optional. By default, all phases are flagged as active. The only potential exception is the phase <CODE>(FE,NI)AL</CODE> of stainless steels, which is flagged as dormant unless both aluminium and nickel are present in the alloy, or when running concentration stepping or multiple points calculations.</LI>
      <LI>The dormant status attribute should only be used for multiphase equilibrium calculations. When set for single phase, Scheil-Gulliver, T<SUB>0</SUB> energy change, or Gibbs energy difference calculations, it has the same effect as excluding the phase from the calculation, and could result in an error.</LI>
      <LI>When requested, the check for the presence (or absence) of a specific phase is performed at the beginning of every Solver calculation. Subsequent checks only apply for temperature, concentration, or extended stepping, as well as Scheil-Gulliver calculations, and require that phase boundaries search is turned on.</LI>
