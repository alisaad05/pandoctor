    <P>The JMatPro API consists of a set of 32-bit and 64-bit C dynamic-link libraries (DLLs), which allows you to integrate some of the functionality of the <A HREF="http://www.sentesoftware.co.uk/jmatpro.aspx" TARGET="_blank">JMatPro software</A> into your own applications. Version 1.0 includes the following modules:</P>
    <UL>
      <LI><A HREF="core.htm">Core</A>. Provides core functionality and contains functions used for general settings, or for settings which are common to several modules.</LI>
      <LI><A HREF="solver.htm">Solver</A>. Provides functions to set up and run thermodynamic calculations of stable and metastable phase equilibria in multicomponent alloys, as well as nonequilibrium Scheil-Gulliver calculations.</LI>
      <LI><A HREF="coldfire.htm">Coldfire</A>. Allows for the calculation of physical, thermophysical, and room-temperature matrix mechanical properties.</LI>
      <LI><A HREF="solidification.htm">Solidification</A>. Provides functions to set up and run calculations of phase evolution, as well as physical and thermophysical properties, during solidification.</LI>
      <LI><A HREF="ttt.htm">TTT</A>. Allows for the calculation of time-temperature transformation (TTT) diagrams of general steels.</LI>
      <LI><A HREF="cct.htm">CCT</A>. Allows for the calculation of continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagrams of general steels.</LI>
