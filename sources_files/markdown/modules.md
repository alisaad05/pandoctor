API modules
===========

The JMatPro API consists of a set of 32-bit and 64-bit C dynamic-link
libraries (DLLs), which allows you to integrate some of the
functionality of the [JMatPro
software](http://www.sentesoftware.co.uk/jmatpro.aspx) into your own
applications. Version 1.0 includes the following modules:

-   [Core](core.htm). Provides core functionality and contains functions
    used for general settings, or for settings which are common to
    several modules.
-   [Solver](solver.htm). Provides functions to set up and run
    thermodynamic calculations of stable and metastable phase equilibria
    in multicomponent alloys, as well as nonequilibrium
    Scheil-Gulliver calculations.
-   [Coldfire](coldfire.htm). Allows for the calculation of physical,
    thermophysical, and room-temperature matrix mechanical properties.
-   [Solidification](solidification.htm). Provides functions to set up
    and run calculations of phase evolution, as well as physical and
    thermophysical properties, during solidification.
-   [TTT](ttt.htm). Allows for the calculation of time-temperature
    transformation (TTT) diagrams of general steels.
-   [CCT](cct.htm). Allows for the calculation of continuous cooling
    transformation (CCT) diagrams of general steels.
